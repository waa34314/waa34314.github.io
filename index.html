<hr> <h2> <em>  Spring Semester 2019  </em> </h2> 
		<div style="text-align:left">	
		<p class="small"> At the start of 2019, I was faced with many decisions in regard to my future, not only academically, but as far as future career prospects. Initially as the semester began I was well aware of the necessity of securing an internship in my degree field through a university program while I still had the opportunity. Prior to my senior year, the pressures or job searching and attempting to start a career had not dawned on me and I wish I woudlve started this process earlier in my college career. Ultimately, my goal was to secure a summer intern position at an organization where I would be able to possibly come back to work for, post graduation. Unaware of the challenges I would be facing with my job search, I also am attempting to fast-track my graduation time and have been in taking 18 hours of class credits in addition to working part-time when I am not class. In the past, I have been in a position of not only being a full-time student but also working full time, and with my senior year facing me I was fortunate enough to be able to cut back on my working hours in order to focus on my studies as well as my career planning. I soon realized that the world load I undertook including: my class schedule, part-time work schedule, and job searching, woudld amount to a workload very simliar to that of my past, working and going to school full time. </p> 
	<p class="small"> Nevertheless I prepared myself for the work ahead and began my process. After countless interviews and career events ranging from in person, to on the phone, to virtual/video conferences, I am happy to say I have accepted an opportunity for the summer months workig with a great organization for which I may have the chance to pursue a future career. Now that the main part of the career process has concluded for me, for now, I am able to turn my focus mainly to my accadmic work. I set out in my final semesters with the goal of raising my GPA and accademic standings. With a time consuming busy course load, this objective has proven to be a bit more challenging that I would've planned however not impossible. As I saw in the fall of 2018, where I was also at an 18 credit hour semester, I have the abilty to fulfill my graduating requirements and obtain a 4.0 semester. For the spring of 2019 I am setting out for the same results. Below is an example of courses during the spring 2019 semester.
	<p class="small"> Furthermore, as we approach the end of the Spring 2019 semster, I am happy to say that I am not only track with my academic goals, but also have secured an internship in my degree field with one of the largest global firms of this industry. With this, over the summer I will be working in their headquarters in Dallas, Texas, before returning to UGA for my final semester in the fall of 2019.  </P>
